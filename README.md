- I was motivated to work on this project to learn how to debug existing code and streamline/consolidate code to be more efficient.

- The problem that was solved is that the website is more accessible for google searches and for those who cannot see images due to connection issues or inabilities to see. 
- I learned the nav property and how it can be used in html. I learned how to structure the content in css to be more effiecent. As well as the fact that I learned how to make websites more accessible.
